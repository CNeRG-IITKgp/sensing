<b><u>Title</u></b>: Topology assessment of smart spaces<br>

<b><u>Broad area</u></b>: IOT<br>

<b><u>Description</u></b>: An unsupervised approach to visualize and assess the sensor network of a smart space, which in turn divulges details about itâ€™s indoor topology. The results are obtained from a smart environment (dataset considered - <a href="http://casas.wsu.edu/datasets/">CASAS</a>) by conducting a series of deductions and analysis on sensor data generated by a smart home.<br>
