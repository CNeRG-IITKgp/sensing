**Title**: Topology assessment of smart spaces <br>

**Broad area**: IOT <br>

**Description**: <br>
An unsupervised approach to visualize and assess the sensor network of a smart space, which in turn divulges details about it’s indoor topology. The results are obtained from a smart environment (dataset considered - [CASAS](http://casas.wsu.edu/datasets/)) by conducting a series of deductions and analysis on sensor data generated by a smart home. <br>

**Title**: GroupSense: A Lightweight Framework for Group Identification<br>

**Broad area**: Ubiquitous Computing<br>

**Description**: <br>
In an organization, individuals prefer to form various formal and informal groups for mutual interactions. Therefore, ubiquitous identification of such groups and understanding their dynamics are important to monitor activities, behaviours and well-being of the individuals. Meeting groups are the groups where co-located group members occasionally interact with each other. Precisely, given a population of subjects U, we define a meeting group G[t,t+T] ⊆ U for the time period [t, t+T ] as the collection of co-located individuals {u ∈ U} sharing similar context.
